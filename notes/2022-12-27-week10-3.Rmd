1. How should we visualize the results from PCA? There are three artifacts
produced by the procedure worth considering — components, scores, and variances.
The components describe derived features, the scores lay samples out on a map,
and the variances summarize how much information was preserved by each
dimension.

```{r}
# produced by code in previous notes
components <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/dituepd0751qqsims22v2liukuk0v4bf.csv") %>%
  filter(component %in% str_c("PC", 1:5))
scores <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/qisbw1an4lo8naifoxyu4dqv4bfsotcu.csv")
variances <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ye125xf8800zc5eh3rfeyzszagqkaswf.csv") %>%
  filter(terms == "percent variance")
```

2. First, let's see how much variance is explained by each dimension of the PCA.
Without detouring into the mathematical explanation, the main idea is that, the
more rapid the dropoff in variance explained, the better the low-dimensional
approximation. For example, if the data actually lie on a 2D plane in a
high-dimensional space, then the first two bars would contain all the variance
(the rest would be zero).

```{r, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 4, fig.cap = "Proportion of variance explained by each component in the PCA."}
ggplot(variances) +
  geom_col(aes(component, value))
```

2. We can interpret components by looking at the linear coefficients of the
variables used to define them. From the plot below, we see that the first PC
mostly captures variation related to whether the drink is made with powdered
sugar or simple syrup. Drinks with high values of PC1 are usually to be made
from simple syrup, those with low values of PC1 are usually made from powdered
sugar. From the two largest bars in PC2, we can see that it highlights the
vermouth vs. non-vermouth distinction.

```{r, fig.cap = "The top 5 principal components associated with the cocktails dataset."}
ggplot(components, aes(value, terms)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~component, nrow = 1) +
  labs(y = NULL) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 7))
```

3. It is often easier read the components when the bars are sorted according to
their magnitude. The usual ggplot approach to reordering axes labels, using
either `reorder()` or releveling the associated factor, will reorder all the
facets in the same way. If we want to reorder each facet on its own, we can use
the `reorder_within` function coupled with `scale_*_reordered`, both from the
tidytext package.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "The top 3 principal components, with defining variables sorted by the magnitude of their coefficient."}
components_ <- components %>%
  filter(component %in% str_c("PC", 1:3)) %>%
  mutate(terms = reorder_within(terms, abs(value), component))
ggplot(components_, aes(value, terms)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ component, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_y_reordered() +
  labs(y = NULL) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 7))
```

4. Next, we can visualize the scores of each sample with respect to these
components. The plot below shows $\left(z_{i1}, z_{i2}\right)$. Suppose that the
columns of $\Phi$ are $\varphi_{1}, \dots, \varphi_{K}$. Then, since $x_{i}
\approx \varphi_{1}z_{i1} + \varphi_{2} z_{i2}$, the samples have large values
for variables with large component values in the coordinate directions where
$z_{i}$ is farther along.

```{r, fig.height = 6, preview = TRUE, fig.cap = "The scores associated with the cocktails dataset."}
ggplot(scores, aes(PC1, PC2, label = name)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = category), alpha = 0.7, size = 1.5) +
  geom_text_repel(check_overlap = TRUE, size = 3) +
  coord_fixed(sqrt(variances$value[2] / variances$value[1])) # rescale axes to reflect variance
```

5. For example, El Nino has high value for PC1, which means it has a high value
of variables that are positive for PC1 (like simple syrup) and low value for
those variables that are negative (like powdered sugar). Similarly, since
$\varphi_{2}$ puts high positive weight on vermouth-related variables, so H. P.
W. Cocktail has many vermouth-related ingredients.

6. In practice, it will often be important to visualize several pairs of PC
dimensions against one another, not just the top 2.

7. Let’s examine the original code in a little more detail. We are using
tidymodels, which is a package for decoupling the definition and execution of a
data pipeline. This compartmentalization makes it easier to design and reuse
across settings.

```{r}
cocktails_df <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/qyqof2512qsek8fpnkqqiw3p1jb77acf.csv")
pca_rec <- recipe(~., data = cocktails_df) %>%
  update_role(name, category, new_role = "id") %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_pca(all_predictors())

pca_prep <- prep(pca_rec)
```

8. Here is how you would apply PCA without the tidymodels package. You have to
first split the data into the "metadata" that is used to interpret the scores
and the numerical variables used as input to PCA. Then at the end, you have to
join the metadata back in. It's not impossible, but the code is not as readable.

```{r, fig.cap = "A plot of the PCA scores made without using tidymodels."}
# split name and category out of the data frame
pca_result <- cocktails_df %>%
  select(-name, -category) %>%
  scale() %>%
  princomp()

# join them back into the PCA result
metadata <- cocktails_df %>%
  select(name, category)
scores_direct <- cbind(metadata, pca_result$scores)

ggplot(scores_direct, aes(Comp.1, Comp.2, label = name)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = category), alpha = 0.7, size = 1.5) +
  geom_text_repel(check_overlap = TRUE, size = 3) +
  coord_fixed(sqrt(variances$value[2] / variances$value[1])) # rescale axes to reflect variance
```

10. The equivalent tidymodels implementation handles the difference between
supplementary and modeling data less bluntly, setting the `name` and `category`
variables to `id` roles, so that `all_predictors()` knows to skip them.

11. We conclude with some characteristics of PCA, which can guide the choice
between alternative dimensionality reduction methods.

  * *Global structure*: Since PCA is looking for high-variance overall, it tends
  to focus on global structure.
  * *Linear*: PCA can only consider linear combinations of the original
  features. If we expect nonlinear features to be more meaningful, then another
  approach should be considered.
  * *Interpretable features*: The PCA components exactly specify how to
  construct each of the derived features.
  * *Fast*: Compared to most dimensionality reduction methods, PCA is quite
  fast. Further, it is easy to implement approximate versions of PCA that scale
  to very large datasets.
  * *Deterministic*: Some embedding algorithms perform an optimization process,
  which means there might be some variation in the results due to randomness in
  the optimization. In contrast, PCA is deterministic, with the components being
  unique up to sign (i.e., you could reflect the components across an axis, but
  that is the most the results might change).
