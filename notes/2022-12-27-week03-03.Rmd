1. Faceting is useful whenever we want different rows of the data to appear in
different panels. What if we want to compare different columns, or work with
several datasets? A more general alternative is to use compound plots. The idea
is to construct plots separately and then combine them only at the very end.

1. The main advantage of compound plots is that individual panels can be
tailored to specific visual comparisons, but relationships across panels can
also be studied. For example, the plot below shows change in the total number
and composition of undergraduate majors over the last few decades. In principle,
the same information could be communicated using a stacked area plot
(`geom_area`). However, comparing the percentages for 1970 and 2015 is much more
straightforward using a line plot, and we can still see changes in the overall
number of degrees using the area plot.
    
    ```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
    # trends in bachelor's degrees plot
    library(tidyverse)
    library(patchwork)
    degrees <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krisrs1128/stat436_s23/main/data/degrees.csv") %>%
        filter(field %in% c("Business", "Health professions and related programs", "Social sciences and history", "Psychology", "Education"))
    
    p <- list()
    p[["trend"]] <- degrees %>%
      group_by(year) %>%
      summarise(total = sum(count)) %>%
      ggplot() +
        geom_area(aes(year, total)) +
        scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
        scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0, 0.1, 0), labels = scales::label_number_si()) +
        labs(x = NULL, y = "degrees awarded")
    
    delta_data <- degrees %>%
      filter(year %in% c(1971, 2015))
    
    p[["delta"]] <- ggplot(delta_data, aes(year_str, perc)) +
      scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0.05, 0.01, 0, 0.9)) +
      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_text(
        data = delta_data %>% filter(year == 2015), 
        aes(label = str_wrap(field, 20)),
        size = 3.5, nudge_x = 0.04, hjust = 0
      ) +
      geom_line(aes(group = field)) +
      labs(x = NULL, y = "proportion of degrees")
    
    p[["trend"]] + p[["delta"]] +
      plot_layout(widths = c(0.65, 0.35))
    ```
    
    For reference, here is a non-compound display of the same information.
        
    ```{r}
    ggplot(degrees) +
      geom_area(aes(year, count, fill = field)) +
        scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
        scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0, 0.1, 0), labels = scales::label_number_si()) +
        scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
    ```
    
1. There are a few considerations that can substantially improve the quality of
a compound plot,

    * Consistent visual encodings for shared variables
    * Clear, but unobtrusive annotation
    * Proper alignment in figure baselines
    
    We will discuss each point separately.
    
1. The figures below are compound plots of a dataset of athlete physiology. They
are very similar, but the second is better because it enforces a more strict
consistency in encodings across panels. Specifically, the male / female variable
is (1) encoded using the same color scheme across all panels and (2) ordered so
that female repeatedly appears on the right of male.
    
    ```{r}
    athletes <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krisrs1128/stat436_s23/main/data/athletes.csv") %>%
      filter(sport %in% c("basketball", "field", "rowing", "swimming", "tennis", "track (400m)"))
    p <- list()
    
    p[["bar"]] <- athletes %>%
      count(sex) %>%
      mutate(sex = factor(sex, levels = c("m", "f"))) %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_bar(aes(sex, n), stat = "identity") +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))
    p[["scatter"]] <- ggplot(athletes) +
      geom_point(aes(rcc, wcc, col = sex)) +
      scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
    p[["box"]] <- ggplot(athletes) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(sport, pcBfat, fill = sex))
    
    (p[["bar"]] + p[["scatter"]]) / p[["box"]]
    ```
    
    The improved, visually consistent approach is given below.
    
    ```{r}
    athletes <- athletes %>%
      mutate(sex = recode(sex, "m" = "male", "f" = "female"))
    
    p[["bar"]] <- athletes %>%
      count(sex) %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_bar(aes(sex, n, fill = sex), stat = "identity") +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
      scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
      labs(y = "number")
    p[["scatter"]] <- ggplot(athletes) +
      geom_point(aes(rcc, wcc, col = sex)) +
      scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
      theme(legend.position = "none") +
      labs(x = "RBC count", y = "WBC Count")
    p[["box"]] <- ggplot(athletes) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(sport, pcBfat, col = sex, fill = sex), alpha = 0.5) +
      scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
      scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
      theme(legend.position = "none") +
      labs(y = "% body fat", x = NULL)
    
    (p[["bar"]] + p[["scatter"]]) / p[["box"]] +
      plot_layout(guides = "collect") &
      plot_annotation(theme = theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
    ```
  
1. Effective annotation can be used to refer to different subpanels of the data
without drawing too much attention to itself. Labels should be visible but
subtle -- not too large, similar fonts as the figures, and logically ordered
((a) on top left). A nice heuristic is to think of these annotations like page
numbers. They are useful for making references, but aren't something that is
actively read.
    
    ```{r}
    p[["bar"]] <- p[["bar"]] + ggtitle("a")
    p[["scatter"]] <- p[["scatter"]] + ggtitle("b")
    p[["box"]] <- p[["box"]] + ggtitle("c")
    
    (p[["bar"]] + p[["scatter"]]) / p[["box"]] +
      plot_layout(guides = "collect") &
      plot_annotation(theme = theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
    ```
  
  1. For alignment, we will want figure baselines / borders to be consistent.
  Misalignment can be distracting. This is primarily a problem when compound plots
  are made from manually. If we follow the programmatic approaches discussed in
  the next lecture, we won't have this issue.
      
      ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = 600}
      include_graphics("https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/multi-panel_figures_files/figure-html/athletes-composite-misaligned-1.png")
      ```
