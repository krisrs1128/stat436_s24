1. There are several packages in R that can be used to fit topic models. We will
use LDA as implemented in the `topicmodels` package,  which expects input to be
structured as a `DocumentTermMatrix`, a special type of matrix that stores the
counts of words (columns) across documents (rows). In practice, most of the
effort required to fit a topic model goes into transforming the raw data into a
suitable `DocumentTermMatrix`.

2. To illustrate this process, let’s consider the "Great Library Heist" example
from the reading. We imagine that a thief has taken four books — Great
Expectations, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, War of the Worlds, and
Pride & Prejudice — and torn all the chapters out. We are left with pieces of
isolated pieces of text and have to determine from which book they are from. The
block below downloads all the books into an R object.

```{r}
titles <- c("Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea", 
            "The War of the Worlds",
            "Pride and Prejudice", 
            "Great Expectations")
books <- gutenberg_works(title %in% titles) %>%
  gutenberg_download(meta_fields = "title")
books
```
3. Since we imagine that the word distributions are not equal across the books,
topic modeling is a reasonable approach for discovering the books associated
with each chapter. Note that, in principle, other clustering and dimensionality
reduction procedures could also work.

4. First, let’s simulate the process of tearing the chapters out. We split the
raw texts anytime the word "Chapter" appears. We will keep track of the book
names for each chapter, but this information is not passed into the topic
modeling algorithm.

```{r}
by_chapter <- books %>%
  group_by(title) %>%
  mutate(
    chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("chapter", ignore_case = TRUE)))
  ) %>%
  group_by(title, chapter) %>%
  mutate(n = n()) %>%
  filter(n > 5) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  unite(document, title, chapter)
```

5. As it is, the text data are long character strings, giving actual text from
the novels. To fit LDA, we only need counts of each word within each chapter --
the algorithm throws away information related to word order. To derive word
counts, we first split the raw text into separate words using the `unest_tokens`
function in the tidytext package. Then, we can count the number of times each
word appeared in each document using `count`, a shortcut for the usual
`group_by` and `summarize(n = n())` pattern.

```{r}
word_counts <- by_chapter %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(document, word) # shortcut for group_by(document, word) %>% summarise(n = n())

word_counts
```

6. These words counts are still not in a format compatible with conversion to a
`DocumentTermMatrix`. The issue is that the `DocumentTermMatrix` expects words
to be arranged along columns, but currently they are stored across rows. The
line below converts the original "long" word counts into a "wide"
`DocumentTermMatrix` in one step. Across these 4 books, we have 65 chapters and
a vocabulary of size 18325.

```{r}
chapters_dtm <- word_counts %>%
  cast_dtm(document, word, n)
chapters_dtm
```

8. Once the data are in this format, we can use the `LDA` function to fit a
topic model. We choose $K = 4$ topics because we expect that each topic will
match a book. Different hyperparameters can be set using the `control` argument.

```{r}
chapters_lda <- LDA(chapters_dtm, k = 4, control = list(seed = 1234))
chapters_lda
```

9. There are two types of outputs produced by the LDA model: the topic word
distributions (for each topic, which words are common?) and the document-topic
memberships (from which topics does a document come from?). For visualization,
it will be easiest to extract these parameters using the `tidy` function,
specifying whether we want the topics (beta) or memberships (gamma).

```{r}
topics <- tidy(chapters_lda, matrix = "beta")
memberships <- tidy(chapters_lda, matrix = "gamma")
```

10. This tidy approach is preferable to extracting the parameters directly from
the fitted model (e.g., using `chapters_lda@gamma`) because it ensures the
output is a tidy data.frame, rather than a matrix. Tidy data.frames are easier
to visualize using ggplot2.

```{r}
# highest weight words per topic
topics %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta)

# topic memberships per document
memberships %>%
  arrange(document, topic)
```
