1. From the previous notes, we see that an exploratory analysis can motivate few
plausible models for a dataset. How should we go about choosing between them?

```{r}
f <- tempfile()
download.file("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/2pzgdu7gyobhl5tezo63tns7by1aiy6d.rda", f)
GM <- get(load(f))
```

2. In some of your other classes, you might have seen people use
cross-validation / test set error. While this is useful (and relatively
automatic), it can  be a black box. An alternative which often brings mores
insight into the structure of the problem is to use prior and posterior
predictive distributions for (visual) model comparison.

### Prior predictive distributions

3. The prior predictive distribution can be used to decide whether certain model
families are reasonable candidates for a problem, before formally incorporating
the evidence coming from the data.

4. The idea is that if we can write down a generative model, then we can
simulate different datasets with it, even before estimating the model
parameters. This is often the case in Bayesian models, where we can (a) sample
parameters from the prior, and (b) simulate data from the model with those
parameters.

5.  If the simulated datasets are plausible, then the overall model class is a
reasonable one. If they are not, then the model class should be modified. Either
the prior or the likelihood might need revision.

6. For example, in the example below, we simulate datasets using both a vague
and an informative prior. Vague priors are often recommended because they are
« more objective » in some sense. However, in this case, we see that the
simulated datasets are not even remotely plausible. 

```{r}
# function to simulate from vague prior
prior1 <- function(Nsim) {
  tau0 <- 1 / sqrt(rgamma(1, 1, rate = 100))
  tau1 <- 1 / sqrt(rgamma(1, 1, rate = 100))
  sigma <- 1 / sqrt(rgamma(1, 1, rate = 100))
  beta0i <- rnorm(7, 0, tau0)
  beta1i <- rnorm(7, 0, tau1)
  beta0 <- rnorm(1, 0, 100)
  beta1 <- rnorm(1, 0, 100)
  
  epsilon <- rnorm(Nsim, 0, sigma)
  data.frame(
    log_pm25 = GM$log_pm25,
    region = GM$super_region_name,
    sim = beta0 + beta0i[GM$super_region] + (beta1 + beta1i[GM$super_region]) * GM$log_sat + epsilon
  )
}
```

```{r, fig.cap = "Prior predictive samples from the vague prior are on a completely implausible scale."}
prior1_data <- map_dfr(1:12, ~ prior1(Nsim = nrow(GM@data)), .id = "replicate")
ggplot(prior1_data, aes(x = log_pm25, y = sim)) + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(col = region), alpha = 0.1, size = 0.4) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(x = "True station data", y = "Simulated station data") +
  facet_wrap(~ replicate, scale = "free_y")
```

7. The block below instead simulates from a subjective, informative prior. The
resulting samples are much more plausible, lying in a comparable range to the
true data. However, note, the samples from the prior predictive do not need to
look exactly like the observed data — if they did, there would be no need to fit
model parameters! Instead, they should look like plausible datasets that might
have been observed.

```{r, fig.cap = "Prior predictive samples from the weakly informative prior seem more plausible, though they do not (and should not) exactly fit the true data."}
# function to simulate from informative prior
prior2 <- function(Nsim) {
  tau0 <- abs(rnorm(1, 0, 1))
  tau1 <- abs(rnorm(1, 0, 1))
  sigma <- abs(rnorm(1, 0, 1))
  beta0i <- rnorm(7, 0, tau0)
  beta1i <- rnorm(7, 0, tau1)
  beta0 <- rnorm(1, 0, 1)
  beta1 <- rnorm(1, 1, 1)
  
  epsilon <- rnorm(Nsim, 0, sigma)
  data.frame(
    log_pm25 = GM$log_pm25,
    region = GM$super_region_name,
    sim = beta0 + beta0i[GM$super_region] + (beta1 + beta1i[GM$super_region]) * GM$log_sat + epsilon
  )
}

prior2_data <- map_dfr(1:12, ~ prior2(Nsim = nrow(GM@data)), .id = "replicate")
ggplot(prior2_data, aes(x = log_pm25, y = sim)) + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(col = region), alpha = 0.1, size = 0.4) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(x = "True station data", y = "Simulated station data") +
  facet_wrap(~ replicate, scale = "free_y")
```

8. Philosophically, this prior predictive analysis is based on the idea that,
though probability is subjective, evidence can be used to update our beliefs.
The idea of the prior predictive is to visually encode subjective beliefs about
the problem under study before gathering new evidence.

### Posterior predictive distributions

9. Once the prior predictive is calibrated, we can fit the model. To evaluate
it’s quality, we can use the posterior predictive.

10. The posterior predictive is just like the prior predictive, except that it
samples model parameters from the data-informed posterior, rather than the
data-ignorant prior.

11. Formally, it is the distribution of new datasets when drawing parameters
from the posterior. The simulation mechanism is (a) draw model parameters from
the posterior and (b) simulate a dataset using parameters from (a).

12. The code below fits the three models. We are using the `rstan` package to
fit three Bayesian models. The first model `lm` is a Bayesian linear regression,
assuming the same slope across all regions. The two other models assume
different slopes for different regions^[Bayesian regression models that allow
different slopes for different groups are called hierarchical models.], but use
the WHO and cluster-based region definitions, respectively. You do not need to
worry about how the `rstan` code, which is sourced into the `stan_model`
function, is written. It is enough to be able to fit these two types of models
as if they are built-in function in R.

```{r}
# Define the input datasets for the lm, region-based, and cluster-based models
datasets <- list(
  "lm" = with(GM@data, list(N = length(log_pm25), y = log_pm25, x = log_sat)),
  "regions" = with(
    GM@data, 
    list(N = length(log_pm25), y = log_pm25, x = log_sat, group = super_region, R = n_distinct(super_region))
  ),
  "clusters" = with(
    GM@data, 
    list(N = length(log_pm25), y = log_pm25, x = log_sat, group = as.integer(cluster_region), R = n_distinct(cluster_region))
  )
)

# Define the two types of Bayesian models
model_def <- list(
  "lm" = stan_model("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/hoq1whain301bj6gj670itxabnnhvcy7.stan"),
  "hier" = stan_model("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/lvouz9jj4rbkmrx5osj2dtrhj2ycdll8.stan")
)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Fit the models above to the three datasets of interest
controls <- list(max_treedepth = 15, adapt_delta = 0.99)
models <- list(
  "lm" = sampling(model_def$lm, data = datasets$lm, chains = 1, control = controls),
  "regions" = sampling(model_def$hier, data = datasets$regions, chains = 1, control = controls),
  "clusters" = sampling(model_def$hier, data = datasets$clusters, chains = 1, control = controls)
)
```

12. The code above takes a little while to run (about 10 minutes for the last
two models). To save some time, you can download the fitted models from the link
below. The `models` object is a list whose elements are fitted STAN models for
the three model definitions above. The fitted model objects include posterior
samples for the region slopes as well as simulated ground station PM2.5 data,
based on those posterior slopes.

```{r}
f <- tempfile()
download.file("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/x7dotair443mhx34yzie3m3lrsvhk19a.rda", f)
models <- get(load(f))
```

13. The block below simulates station PM2.5 data from the fitted posterior of
the cluster-based model. Note that, compared to the prior predictive, the
posterior predictive is much more closely related to the true underlying
dataset.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "Samples from the posterior predictive in the cluster-based model."}
# extract 12 samples and reshape it to "long" format
posterior_samples <- as.matrix(models$clusters, pars = "y_sim")[950:961, ] %>%
  t() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  bind_cols(GM@data) %>%
  pivot_longer(V1:V12, names_to = "replicate", values_to = "log_pm25_sim")

ggplot(posterior_samples, aes(log_pm25, log_pm25_sim)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(col = cluster_region), size = 0.4, alpha = 0.1) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(x = "True station data", y = "Simulated station data") +
  facet_wrap(~ replicate, scale = "free_y")
```

14. We can verify that features of the real dataset are accurately captured by
features of the posterior predictive. One subtlety is that there is a danger of
overfitting features in the posterior predictive. It is best to choose features
of the data that are not directly modeled (e.g., if you use slope in the model
estimation, then don’t evaluate the posterior predictive using the slope, since
by definition this will be well-captured). In the block below, we compute the
skewness for each simulated station dataset from the three different models.
These skewnesses are plotted as histograms, with the true dataset's skewness
indicated by a vertical line. It seems that the model that uses clustering to
define regions is able to simulate datasets with skewness similar to that in the
real dataset.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 10, fig.cap = "Posterior simulated skewness according to the three different models."}
apply_stat <- function(x, f) {
  z <- as.matrix(x, pars = "y_sim")
  tibble(
    "replicate" = seq_len(nrow(z)),
    "statistic" = apply(z, 1, f)
  )
}

skew <- function(x) {
  xdev <- x - mean(x)
  n <- length(x)
  r <- sum(xdev^3) / sum(xdev^2)^1.5
  r * sqrt(n) * (1 - 1/n)^1.5
}

posteriors <- map_dfr(models, ~ apply_stat(., skew), .id = "model")
truth <- skew(GM@data$log_pm25)
ggplot(posteriors, aes(statistic)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = model), binwidth = 0.01) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = truth, col = "red") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
