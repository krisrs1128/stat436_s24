_[Reading](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), [Recording](https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/Week%204%20%5B4%5D%20Tidy%20Data%20Example/1_5qy0fl9h), [Rmarkdown](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat436_s24/blob/main/notes/2024-12-27-week02-04.Rmd)_

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

1. Let’s work through the example of tidying a WHO dataset. This was discussed
in the reading and is good practice in pivoting and deriving new variables.

2. The raw data, along with a summary from the `skimr` package, is shown below
(notice the small multiples!).

```{r}
who
```
```{r}
skim(who)
```
3. According to the data dictionary, the columns have the following meanings,

* The first three letters -> are we counting new or old cases of TB?
* Next two letters -> Type of tab.
* Sixth letter -> Sex of patients
* Remaining numbers -> Age group. E.g., `3544` should be interpreted as 35 - 44
years old.

4. Our first step is to `pivot_longer`. There is quite a bit of information
implicitly stored in the column names, and we want to make those variables
explicitly available for visual encoding.

```{r}
who_longer <- who %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65,  # notice we can refer to groups of columns without naming each one
    names_to = "key", 
    values_to = "cases", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE # if a cell is empty, we do not keep it in the tidy version
  )

who_longer
```

5. The new column `key` contains several variables at once. We can `separate` it
into gender and age group.

```{r}
who_separate <- who_longer %>% 
  mutate(key = str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel")) %>%
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_") %>%
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)

who_separate
```


6. While we have performed each step one at a time, it’s possible to chain them
into a single block of code. This is good practice, because it avoids having to
define intermediate variables that are only ever used once. This is also
typically more concise.

```{r}
who %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, 
    names_to = "key", 
    values_to = "cases", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE # if a cell is empty, we do not keep it in the tidy version
  ) %>%
  mutate(key = str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel")) %>%
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_") %>%
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
```

7. A recommendation for visualization in javascript. We have only discussed tidying in R. While there is work to implement tidy-style transformations in javascript, the R tidyverse provides a more mature suite of tools. If you are making an interactive visualization in javascript, I recommend first tidying data in R so that each row corresponds to a visual mark and each column to a visual property. You can always save the result as either a json or csv, which can serve as the source data for your javascript visualization.
