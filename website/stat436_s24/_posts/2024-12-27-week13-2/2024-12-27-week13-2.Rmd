1. In the last lecture, we discussed the conceptual foundations of feature
learning. In this lecture, we’ll see how to extract and visualize features
learned by a computer vision model.

2. We will inspect a model that was trained^[For those who are curious, the
training code is
[here](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat479/blob/master/_posts/2021-04-12-week13-1/train_model.Rmd)).
Of course, you will not be responsible for understanding this step.] to
distinguish between photos of cats and dogs. We've included a subsample of the
training dataset below -- the full dataset can be downloaded
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). From the printout, you can
see that we have saved 20 images, each of size $150 \times 150$ pixels, and with
three color channels (red, green, and blue).

```{r}
f <- tempfile()
download.file("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/o7t3nt77iv3twizyv7yuwqnca16f9nwi.rda", f)
images <- get(load(f))
dim(images) # 20 sample images
```

3. Let’s take a look at a few examples from the training dataset. We've randomly
sampled 10 dogs and 10 cats. The command `par` allows us to plot many images
side by side (in this case, in a $4 \times 5$ grid).

```{r, layout = "l-body-ouset", fig.cap = "A sample of 20 random images from the dog vs. cat training dataset."}
par(mfrow = c(4, 5), mai = rep(0.00, 4))
out <- images %>%
  array_tree(1) %>%
  map(~ plot(as.raster(., max = 255)))
```

3. The `array_tree` function above splits the 4D array into a collection of 3D
slices. Each of these 3D slices corresponds to one image — the three channels
correspond to red, green, and blue colors, respectively. The next `map` line
plots each of the resulting 3D arrays

4. Next, let’s consider what types of features the model has learned, in order
to distinguish between cats and dogs. Our approach will be to compute
activations on a few images and visualize them as 2D feature maps. These
visualizations will help us see whether there are systematic patterns in what
leads to an activation for a particular neuron.

5. To accomplish this, we will create an R object to retrieve all the
intermediate feature activations associated with an input image. Every time we
call this object on a new image, it will return the activations for features at
all layers.

```{r}
# download model
f <- tempfile()
download.file("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/9wu6amgizhgnnefwrnyqzkf8glb6ktny.h5", f)
model <- load_model_hdf5(f)

layer_outputs <- map(model$layers, ~ .$output)
activation_model <- keras_model(inputs = model$input, outputs = layer_outputs)
features <- predict(activation_model, images)
```

6. Each element of `features` corresponds to a different layer. Within a single
layer, the 3D array provides the activations of each feature across different
spatial windows. For example, for the first layer, there are 32 features with
activations spread across a 148 x 148 grid, each grid element with its own
spatial context.

```{r}
dim(features[[1]])
```
7. The block below visualizes the first feature map in the first layer. We plot
the associated input image next to it. This feature seems to be a horizontal
edge detector -- it activates whenever there are transitions from dark to light
areas when moving vertically. For example, when the white leash goes over the
shadow in the background, this feature has some of its highest activations.

```{r, fig.cap = "An image and its activations for the first neuron in layer 1."}
plot_feature <- function(feature) {
  rotate <- function(x) t(apply(x, 2, rev))
  image(rotate(feature), axes = FALSE, asp = 1, col = brewer.pal(4, "Blues"))
}

ix <- 3
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mai = rep(0.00, 4))
plot(as.raster(images[ix,,, ], max = 255))
plot_feature(features[[1]][ix,,, 1])
```

8. Let’s visualize a few more of these features. We see more vertical and
horizontal edge detectors — features with high values at sharp changes in color
in the underlying images. This is consistent with our earlier claim that the
first layer of a network learns to recognize pixel-level interactions.

```{r, layout = "l-body-ouset", preview = TRUE, fig.cap = "Activations for a collection of neurons at layer 2, for the same image as given above."}
par(mfrow = c(6, 7), mai = rep(0.00, 4))
out <- features[[2]][ix,,,] %>%
  array_branch(margin = 3) %>%
  map(~ plot_feature(.))
```

9. Next, we visualize features at a higher level in the network. At this point,
each activation corresponds to a larger spatial context in the original image,
so there are fewer activations per feature. There are more feature maps total,
but each is smaller. It's not so clear what these feature maps correspond to,
but there do seem to be a few that are clearly activated within the dog, and
others that are sensitive to the foliage in the background.

```{r, layout = "l-body-ouset", fig.cap = "Activations for a collection of neurons at layer 6."}
par(mfrow = c(6, 7), mai = rep(0.00, 4))
out <- features[[6]][ix,,,1:40] %>%
  array_branch(margin = 3) %>%
  map(~ plot_feature(.))
```

9. While we had some interpretations for these higher-level features, it’s hard
to know definitively, since we are only considering a single image. In the next
set of notes, we will examine the same neuron across many dataset examples, and
this will give us more confidence in our interpretations of individual neurons.
