1.  In our last notes, we saw how we could organize a collection of
    images based on average pixel brightness. We can think of average
    pixel brightness as a derived feature that can be used to build a
    low-dimensional map.

2.  We can partially automate the process of deriving new features.
    Though, in general, finding the best way to combine raw features
    into derived ones is a complicated problem, we can simplify things
    by restricting attention to,

-   Features that are linear combinations of the raw input columns.
-   Features that are orthogonal to one another.
-   Features that have high variance.

1.  Restricting to *linear combinations* allows for an analytical
    solution. We will relax this requirement when discussing UMAP.

2.  *Orthogonality* means that the derived features will be uncorrelated
    with one another. This is a nice property, because it would be
    wasteful if features were redundant.

3.  *High variance* is desirable because it means we preserve more of
    the essential structure of the underlying data. For example, if you
    look at this 2D representation of a 3D object, it’s hard to tell
    what it is,

What is this object?
</p>

But when viewing an alternative reduction which has higher variance…

1.  Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is the optimal dimensionality
    reduction under these three restrictions, in the sense that it finds
    derived features with the highest variance. Formally, PCA finds a
    matrix *Φ* ∈ ℝ<sup>*D* × *K*</sup> and a set of vector
    *z*<sub>*i*</sub> ∈ ℝ<sup>*K*</sup> such that
    *x*<sub>*i*</sub> ≈ *Φ**z*<sub>*i*</sub> for all *i*. The columns of
    *Φ* are called principal components, and they specify the structure
    of the derived linear features. The vector *z*<sub>*i*</sub> is
    called the score of *x*<sub>*i*</sub> with respect to these
    components. The top component explains the most variance, the second
    captures the next most, and so on.

2.  For example, if one of the columns of *Φ* was equal to
    $\left(\frac{1}{D}, \dots, \frac{1}{D}\right)$, then that feature
    computes the average of all coordinates (e.g., to get average
    brightness), and the corresponding *z*<sub>*i*</sub> would be a
    measure of the average brightness of sample *i*.

3.  Geometrically, the columns of *Φ* span a plane that approximates the
    data. The *z*<sub>*i*</sub> provide coordinates of points projected
    onto this plane.

1.  In R, PCA can be conveniently implemented using the tidymodels
    package. We will see a base R implementation in the next lecture.
    The
    [dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-26/readme.md)
    below contains properties of a variety of cocktails, from the Boston
    Bartender’s guide. The first two columns are qualitative
    descriptors, while the rest give numerical ingredient information.

1.  The `pca_rec` object below defines a tidymodels recipe for
    performing PCA. Computation of the lower-dimensional representation
    is deferred until `prep()` is called. This delineation between
    workflow definition and execution helps clarify the overall
    workflow, and it is typical of the tidymodels package.

<!-- -->

    pca_rec <- recipe(~., data = cocktails_df) %>%
      update_role(name, category, new_role = "id") %>%
      step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
      step_pca(all_predictors())

    pca_prep <- prep(pca_rec)

1.  The `step_normalize` call is used to center and scale all the
    columns. This is needed because otherwise columns with larger
    variance will have more weight in the final dimensionality
    reduction, but this is not conceptually meaningful. For example, if
    one of the columns in a dataset were measuring length in kilometers,
    then we could artificially increase its influence in a PCA by
    expressing the same value in meters. To achieve invariance to this
    change in units, it would be important to normalize first.

2.  We can `tidy` each element of the workflow object. Since PCA was the
    second step in the workflow, the PCA components can be obtained by
    calling tidy with the argument “2.” The scores of each sample with
    respect to these components can be extracted using `juice.` The
    amount of variance explained by each dimension is also given by
    `tidy`, but with the argument `type = "variance"`. We’ll see how to
    visualize and interpret these results in the next lecture.
