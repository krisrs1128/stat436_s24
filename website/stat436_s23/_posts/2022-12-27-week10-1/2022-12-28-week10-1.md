1.  *High-dimensional data* are data where many features are collected
    for each observation. These tend to be wide datasets with many
    columns. The name comes from the fact that each row of the dataset
    can be viewed as a vector in a high-dimensional space (one dimension
    for each feature). These data are common in modern applications,

-   Each cell in a genomics dataset might have measurements for hundreds
    of molecules.
-   Each survey respondent might provide answers to dozens of questions.
-   Each image might have several thousand pixels.
-   Each document might have counts across several thousand relevant
    words.

1.  For low-dimensional data, we could visually encode all the features
    in our data directly, either using properties of marks or through
    faceting. In high-dimensional data, this is no longer possible.

2.  However, though there are many features associated with each
    observation, it may still be possible to organize samples across a
    smaller number of meaningful, derived features.

3.  For example, consider the Metropolitan Museum of Art dataset, which
    contains images of many artworks. Abstractly, each artwork is a
    high-dimensional object, containing pixel intensities across many
    pixels. But it is reasonable to derive a feature based on the
    average brightness.

1.  In general, manual feature construction can be difficult.
    Algorithmic approaches try streamline the process of generating
    these maps by optimizing some more generic criterion. Different
    algorithms use different criteria, which we will review in the next
    couple of lectures.

1.  Informally, the goal of dimensionality reduction techniques is to
    produce a low-dimensional “atlas” relating members of a collection
    of complex objects. Samples that are similar to one another in the
    high-dimensional space should be placed near one another in the
    low-dimensional view. For example, we might want to make an atlas of
    artworks, with similar styles and historical periods being placed
    near to one another.
