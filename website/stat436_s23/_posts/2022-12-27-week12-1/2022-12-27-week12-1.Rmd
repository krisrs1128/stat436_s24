1. As more complex models become more common in practice, visualization has
emerged as a key way for (a) summarizing their essential structure and (b)
motivating further modeling refinements.

2. In modern machine learning, it's common to use a function $f$ to approximate
the relationship between a $D$-dimensional input $\mathbf{x}$ and a univariate
response $y$. We are given a sample of $n$ pairs $\left(\mathbf{x}_{i},
y_{i}\right)$ with which to learn this relationship, and we hope that the
function we learn will generalize to future observations.

3. Some further notation: We will write $x_{j}$ for the $j^{th}$ coordinate of
$\mathbf{x}$. We will write $\mathbf{x}^{j\vert = z}$ to denote the observation
$\mathbf{x}$ with the $j^{th}$ coordinate set to $z$.

```{r, fig.cap = "Illustration of the $\\mathbf{x}^{j \\vert = z}$ operation. The $j^{th}$ coordinate (1 in this case) for a selected observation is set equal to $z$.", echo = FALSE, out.width = 700}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/l6u0y1l8ww6fikiihjin5ov60pc6qr8b.png")
```

4.  Linear models are simple enough that they don’t require any follow-up visual
inspection. Since they assume $f\left(\mathbf{x}\right) =
\hat{\beta}^{T}\mathbf{x}$, they are completely described by the vector of
coefficients $\hat{\beta}$. We can exactly describe what happens to $f$ when we
increase $x_{j}$ by one unit: we just increase the prediction by
$\hat{\beta}_{j}$.

5. More complex models — think random forests or neural networks — don’t have
this property. While these models often have superior performance, it’s hard to
say how changes in particular input features will affect the prediction.

6. Partial dependence plots try to address this problem. They provide a
description for how changing the $j^{th}$ input feature affects the predictions
made by complex models.

7. To motivate the definition, consider the toy example below. The surface is
the fitted function $f\left(\mathbf{x}\right)$, mapping a two dimensional input
$\mathbf{x}$ to a real-valued response. How would you summarize the relationship
between $x_{1}$ and $y$? The main problem is that the shape of the relationship
depends on which value of $x_{2}$ we start at.

```{r, fig.cap = "An example of why it is difficult to summarize the relationship between an input variable and a fitted surface for nonlinear models.", echo = FALSE, out.width = 500}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/moztt0q240waytarit786j4ry1xe93g6.png")
```

8. One idea is to consider the values of $x_{2}$ that were observed in our
dataset. Then, we can evaluate our model over a range of values $x_{1}$ after
fixing those values of $x_{2}$. These curves are called Ceteris Paribus
profiles^[Ceteris Paribus means « All Else Held Equal. »].

9. The same principle holds in higher dimensions. We can fix $D - 1$ coordinates
of an observation and then evaluate what happens to a sample’s predictions when
we vary coordinate $j$. Mathematically, this is expressed by $h_{x}^{f,
j}\left(z\right) := f\left(\mathbf{x}^{j\vert= z}\right)$.

```{r, fig.cap = "Visual intuition behind the CP profile. Varying the $j^{th}$ coordinate for an observation traces out a curve in the prediction surface.", preview = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = 700}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/mpe45nor6xm4gt1idhedayw9ik754c2k.png")
```

10. For example, let's consider how CP can be used to understand a model fitted
to the Titanic dataset. This is a dataset that was used to understand what
characteristics survivors of the Titanic disaster had in common. It's not
obvious in advance which characteristics of passengers made them more likely to
survive, so a model is fitted to predict survival.

```{r}
data(titanic)
titanic <- select(titanic, -country) %>%
  na.omit()

x <- select(titanic, -survived)
hyper <- data.frame(n.trees = 100, interaction.depth = 8, shrinkage = 0.1, n.minobsinnode = 10)
fit <- train(x = x, y = titanic$survived, method = "gbm", tuneGrid = hyper, verbose = F)
```

11. Next, we can compute the CP profiles. We are showing the relationship
between age and survival, though any subset of variables could be requested. The
bold curve is a Partial Dependence (PD) profile, which we will discuss below.
Each of the other curves corresponds to a passenger, though only a subsample is
shown. The curves are obtained by fixing all the characteristics of the
passanger except for age, and then seeing what happens to the prediction when
the age variable is increased or decreased.

```{r, fig.cap = "CP and PDP profiles for age, for a GBM fitted to the Titanic dataset."}
explanation <- explain(model = fit, data = x, y = titanic$survived)
profile <- model_profile(explainer = explanation)
plot(profile, geom = "profiles", variables = "age") +
  theme479
```

12. It seems that children had the highest probability^[Technically, these are
all predicted probabilities from the model.] of survival. The relationship is
far from linear, with those between 40 and 60 all having about the same
probabilities. Notice that the profiles are vertically offset from one passenger
to another. This is because, aside from age, each passenger had characteristics
that made them more or less likely to survive.

13. We used the DALEX package to produce these curves. The `explain` function
takes the fitted model and original dataset as input. It returns an object with
many kinds of model summaries. To extract the CP profiles from these summaries,
we use `model_profile`. The output of this function has been designed so that
calling `plot` with `geom = "profiles"` will show the CP profiles.

14. The PD profile is computed by averaging across all the CP profiles. It is a
more concise alternative to CP profiles, showing one curve per features, rather
than one curve per sample.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
plot(profile, geom = "aggregates") +
  theme479
```

14. Not only are the PD plots simpler to read than the full collection of CP
profiles — by performing this aggregation step, subtle patterns may become more
salient, for the same reason that an average carries more information than any
subset of observations.
