1.  Nonlinear dimension reduction methods can give a more faithful
    representation than PCA when the data don’t lie on a low-dimensional
    linear subspace.

2.  For example, suppose the data were shaped like this. There is no
    one-dimensional line through these data that separate the groups
    well. We will need an alternative approach to reducing
    dimensionality if we want to preserve nonlinear structure.

1.  From a high-level, the intuition behind UMAP is to (a) build a graph
    joining nearby neighbors in the original high-dimensional space, and
    then (b) layout the graph in a lower-dimensional space.

2.  For example, consider the 2-dimensional sine wave below. If we build
    a graph, we can try to layout the resulting nodes and edges on a
    1-dimensional line in a way that approximately preserves the
    ordering.

![UMAP (and many other nonlinear methods) begins by constructing a graph
in the high-dimensional space, whose layout in the lower dimensional
space will ideally preserve the essential relationships between
samples.](https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/k4hrx2s4cqmmheg6u0yclir8op42sb0s.png)

1.  A natural way to build a graph is to join each node to its *K*
    closest neighbors. The choice of *K* will influence the final
    reduction, and it is treated as a hyperparameter of UMAP.

![When using fewer nearest neighbors, the final dimensionality reduction
will place more emphasis on effectively preserving the relationships
between points in local
neighborhoods.](https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ns6mpykr2zux3t35wuejc7ybtxngm98e.png)

1.  Larger values of *K* prioritize preservation of global structure,
    while smaller *K* will better reflect local differences. This
    property is not obvious a priori, but is suggested by the
    simulations described in the reading.

![When using larger neighborhoods, UMAP will place more emphasis on
preserving global structure, sometimes at the cost of local
relationships between
points.](https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/70utv1s9yv3h5kturf6i02knhi2jw2dl.png)

1.  One detail in the graph construction: In UMAP, the edges are
    assigned weights depending on the distance they span, normalized by
    the distance to the closest neighbor. Neighbors that are close,
    relative to the nearest neighbors, are assigned higher weights than
    those that are far away, and points that are linked by high weight
    edges are pulled together with larger force in the final graph
    layout. This is what the authors mean by using a “fuzzy” nearest
    neighbor graph. The fuzziness allows the algorithm to distinguish
    neighbors that are very close from those that are far, even though
    they all lie within a *K*-nearest-neighborhood.

2.  Once the graph is constructed, there is the question of how the
    graph layout should proceed. UMAP uses a variant of force-directed
    layout, and the global strength of the springs is another
    hyperparameter. Lower tension on the springs allow the points to
    spread out more loosely, higher tension forces points closer
    together. This is a second hyperparameter of UMAP.

1.  These two hyperparameters — the number of nearest neighbors *K* and
    the layout tension — are the only two hyperparameters of UMAP.

2.  You can see more examples of what this algorithm does to toy
    datasets in the
    [reading](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap). Note in
    particular the properties that the algorithm *does not* preserve.
    The distance between clusters should not be interpreted, since it
    just means that the graph components were not connected. Similarly,
    the density of points is not preserved.

3.  In R, we can implement this using almost the same code as we used
    for PCA. The `step_umap` command is available through the embed
    package.

    cocktails_df <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/qyqof2512qsek8fpnkqqiw3p1jb77acf.csv")
    umap_rec <- recipe(~., data = cocktails_df) %>%
      update_role(name, category, new_role = "id") %>%
      step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
      step_umap(all_predictors(), neighbors = 20, min_dist = 0.1)
    umap_prep <- prep(umap_rec)

1.  UMAP returns a low-dimensional atlas relating the points, but it
    does not provide any notion of derived features.

      geom_point(aes(color = category), alpha = 0.7, size = 0.8) +
      geom_text(aes(label = name), check_overlap = TRUE, size = 3, hjust = "inward")

1.  We can summarize the properties of UMAP,

-   *Global or local structure*: The number of nearest neighbors *K*
    used during graph construction can be used modulate the emphasis of
    global vs. local structure.
-   *Nonlinear*: UMAP can reflect nonlinear structure in
    high-dimensions.
-   *No interpretable features*: UMAP only returns the map between
    points, and there is no analog of components to describe how the
    original features were used to construct the map.
-   *Slower*: While UMAP is much faster than comparable nonlinear
    dimensionality reduction algorithms, it is still slower than linear
    approaches.
-   *Nondeterministic*: The output from UMAP can change from run to run,
    due to randomness in the graph layout step. If exact reproducibility
    is required, a random seed should be set.
