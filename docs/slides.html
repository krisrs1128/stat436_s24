# STAT 436: Statistical Data Visualization

## Spring 2024



---


### Welcome!!

I'm excited to share this course with you this semester. There are few
activities that engage creative, quantitative, and critical thinking skills all
at once, but data visualization is one of them.

Nothing makes my day like a good data visualization, and I look forward to
seeing those that you create.

### Learning Outcomes

1.	Develop a vocabulary of visual encodings that support exploration of
geospatial, temporal, tree-structured, and network data, and demonstrate
facility implementing them using packages in the R programming language.
1.	Design dynamic queries that support interactive visualization of
heterogeneous data, and demonstrate facility implementing them using the shiny
package in the R programming language.
1.	Design effective visualizations to summarize the results of dimensionality
reduction and clustering algorithms.

---

### Learning Outcomes

1.	Use visual artifacts derived from complex statistical and machine learning
models to discuss the patterns they learn and mistakes they make.
1.	Evaluate strengths and weaknesses of visualizations in relation to the tasks
they support.

### Advice from Previous Students

* Past Portfolios: [https://go.wisc.edu/hllk12](https://go.wisc.edu/hllk12/)
* Past Advice: [https://go.wisc.edu/l76v31](https://go.wisc.edu/l76v31)

"Go to class! Homework will take a lot less time if you attend class, it’s more efficient."

"Put effort into the exam cheat sheets since you will be able to use them beyond this course"

"Choose topics and datasets that are interesting to you for both individual and group projects, not just a safe and easy dataset. Not only will you be presenting your projects at the end, but you can put it on your resume or github. Kill two birds with one stone."

---

### Exercise 1-1

1. Introduce yourself to your neighbors. Share your name, degree program, and
one of: a recent hobby, favorite movie, favorite food.

1. Submit a response to [Formulating Questions] on Canvas and share your chosen
dataset with your neighbors.

1. We will not grade the plot's quality -- we just want to get a sense of
everyone's starting point.

---

### Exercise 1-1

[Formulating Questions] Pick a dataset from
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#datasets), [Data Is
Plural](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0),
[Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [Google Dataset
Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), or your own personal
studies that you would like to visualize this semester. 

a. What makes you interested in this dataset? What questions does it help to answer?

b. Using any tools of your choice, make one example visualization from your
    dataset. What was your thought process behind the design of this
    visualization? This will not be evaluated except for effort -- the purpose
    of the problem is to create a record your data visualization skills at the
    start of the course. Submit both your visualization and code used to create
    it.

### Exercise Review

.center[
  &lt;img src="figure/info-food-waste.png" width=700/&gt;
]

---

### Exercise Review

* What is the meaning of these scales? Are 20 million slices of bread really
comparable to 290,000 kg of poultry? What about CO2 equivalents?
* A barchart would make quantitative comparisons much easier, especially for
smaller circles
* Bright pink background...
* The text is sometimes quite small
* Are apples really vegetables??
* The icons are nice

---

### Exercise Review

.center[
 &lt;img src="figure/mosquito-predators.jpeg" width=600/&gt;
]

---

### Exercise Review

* This is actually quite elegant, though the visualization form is not that
standard.
* Several responses commented that additional labeling or color would help. Some of the existing annotation lacks context. I
would caution that these additions should not come at the cost of the current
information density.
* In an interactive version, it would be nice to be able to filter by predation
type

---

### Exercise Review

.center[
 &lt;img src="figure/elife_sunflower.jpeg" width=500/&gt;
]

---

### Exercise Review

* This is a very dense visualization, appropriate for a scientific venue, but
requiring significant time to parse (though if a lot is learned through the
process, this need not be a bad thing)
* Having the scatterplot icons look like the properties of the sunflowers they
are studying was a brilliant idea.
* The linking of the same color across many subplots is a good practice.
However, the circle sizes are not consistent between (a) and (b).
* Some of the text makes the figure unnecessarily busy. E.g., do we really need
to know latitude and longitude?

---

### In-Class Demo [2-1]

We will work through [Plant Growth Experiment] in the exercises sheet.

* Live Demo: https://go.wisc.edu/24yni7
* Whiteboard: https://go.wisc.edu/dadqnl
* Completed Code: https://go.wisc.edu/tm5cw4

---

### Notebook Submissions

* Make sure to remove extraneous package loading messages from your
exercise and homework solutions.
* There are also ways to customize the output colors, fonts, etc.
* Let's look at how to do this with the previous demo.

---

### In-Class Exercise [2 - 1]

* Submit an answer to [Code Analysis] from the exercises sheet.

[Code Analysis] Pick one code example from this week’s lecture notes. Provide a
3 - 4 sentence summary of the overall implementation strategy. Then, add
comments every 10 - 15 lines describing what each section of code is doing. If
there are parts that you do not understand, add a ??? next to it (we will review
these in the next lecture).

### Exercise Review 2 - 1

* Pipe syntax seems to be a new concept. The main idea is to avoid storing
intermediate computations.

### Exercise Review 2 - 1

The theme only applies to visualizations **after** the `theme_set` call.


```r
# set the theme
my_theme &lt;- theme_bw() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(size = 16),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 16),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 14),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 16)
  )
theme_set(my_theme)
#?? I don't know why the theme doesn't setted. 
```

---

### Exercise Review 2 - 1



```r
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(mpg, hp))
```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="650" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

### Exercise Review 2 - 1


```r
my_theme &lt;- theme_bw() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(size = 16),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 16),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 14),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 16)
  )
theme_set(my_theme)
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(mpg, hp))
```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="650" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---

### Exercise Review 2 - 1

The plants demo used a regular expression ("regex") to extract the day number
from the column names.


```r
plants_reshaped &lt;- plants |&gt;
  pivot_longer(starts_with("height")) |&gt;
  mutate(day = str_extract(name, "[0-9]+")) #???
```

---

### Exercise Review 2 - 1


```r
str_extract("height.14", "[0-9]")
```

```
## [1] "1"
```

---

### Exercise Review 2 - 1


```r
str_extract("height.14", "[0-9]+")
```

```
## [1] "14"
```

---

### Exercise Review 2 - 1


```r
str_extract("height.14.test.21", "[0-9]+")
```

```
## [1] "14"
```

---

### Exercise Review 2 - 1


```r
str_extract_all("height.14.test.21", "[0-9]+")
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "14" "21"
```

Hint: https://regexr.com/ is useful for learning and testing regexes.

---

### Exercise Review 2 - 1

* The first two arguments (`day` and `value`) always define the x and y axes in any ggplot layer
* `interaction` defines a temporary factor variable that looks at all combinations


```r
ggplot(plants_reshaped) +
  geom_line(aes(day, value, group = interaction(plantid, treatment), col = treatment))
```

`group` specifies what each line should correspond to. So here, it corresponds
to `plantid x treatment` combinations.

---

### Exercise Review 2 - 1


```r
interaction(1:4, c("A", "B", "C"))
```

```
## [1] 1.A 2.B 3.C 4.A
## Levels: 1.A 2.A 3.A 4.A 1.B 2.B 3.B 4.B 1.C 2.C 3.C 4.C
```

### In-Class Exercise [2 - 2]

Work through [Ikea Furniture] part (a) in the exercise sheet.

As you prepare your solution, respond to the [Code Diary] (https://go.wisc.edu/62wr52) questions.

If you finish part (a) during class, try to complete (b - c) as well.

---

[Ikea Furniture] The dataset below shows prices of pieces of Ikea furniture.
We will compare prices of different furniture categories and label the
(relatively few) articles which cannot be bought online.


```r
ikea &lt;- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/iat31h1wjg7abhd2889cput7k264bdzd.csv")
```
a. Make a plot that shows the relationship between the `category` of furniture
and `price` (on a log-scale). Show each `item_id` as a point -- do not aggregate
to boxplots or ridgelines -- but make sure to jitter and adjust the size the
points to reduce the amount of overlap. _Hint: use `geom_jitter`._

b. Modify the plot in (a) so that categories are sorted from those with highest
to lowest average prices.

c. Color points according to whether they can be purchased online. If they
cannot be purchased online, add a text label giving the name of that item of
furniture.

### Exercise Review

_Whenever possible, each panel in a faceted plot should be made to have its own `\(y\)`-axis scale._

---

### Exercise Review

_When using the `patchwork` package, two plots `p1` and `p2` can be placed side-by-side using `p1 / p2`._

---

### Exercise Review

_When using the `patchwork` package, the `plot_layout` function can be used to collect legends._


---

### Exercise Review

_Relative to interactively filtered displays, faceted plots are less taxing on the reader's memory._

### Shiny Apps in Problem Sets

If you tried compiling a Shiny app within an rmarkdown document, you probably
saw a message like the one below,

&lt;img src="figures/shiny_rmarkdown.png"/&gt;

You did not make a mistake! Shiny doesn't allow you to host an app within an
Rmarkdown document, unfortunately.

---

### Shiny Apps in Submissions

To let us grade your Shiny apps within the problem sets, you have two options,

1. Include a screen recording of your app along with the code you used to create
it. You do not need to share the code as R scripts -- we will just read the code
as it's embedded in the main write-up.

1. You could try hosting your app on a public site. UW Madison has an Rstudio
Connect account, which lets you host apps for free. You can sign up
[here](https://it.wisc.edu/news/rstudio-team-pilot/).

---

### Discussion Review

A few main themes came up in Thursday's discussion (https://go.wisc.edu)

* Making sense of Shiny-specific vocabulary and syntax
* Which Shiny components should we use when? What considerations guide the
choice?
* How to debug Shiny apps?

### Shiny-specific Syntax

What is the difference between `ui` and `server`?

* The `ui` defines what the user sees and can interact with.
* The `server` defines how the visualization responds to inputs.

---

### Shiny-specific Syntax

What is the difference between `observe` and `reactive`?

From Mastering Shiny, Section 3.6,

&gt; [S]ometimes you need to reach outside of the app and cause side-effects to
happen elsewhere in the world. This might be saving a file to a shared network
drive, sending data to a web API, updating a database, or (most commonly)
printing a debugging message to the console. These actions don’t affect how your
app looks, so you shouldn’t use an output and a render function. Instead you
need to use an observer.

---

### Which Components to Use When?

* For choosing between different inputs and outputs, the [Shiny Cheat
Sheet](https://shiny.rstudio.com/images/shiny-cheatsheet.pdf) is helpful. It
shows screenshots of each type of input / output.
* Many authors have implemented inputs / outputs beyond those available in the main Shiny package. E.g., there are specialized widgets in the [`shinyWidgets`](https://shinyapps.dreamrs.fr/shinyWidgets/) package

---

### Which Components to Use When?

* For more complex displays, you may want to use `sidebarLayout`, `tabsetPanel`,
or `navbarPage`
* We will practice with alternatives during the Thursday demo

---

### Debugging Shiny Apps

In addition to printing to the R console or inserting a `browser()` call, you
can create UI elements that print variables of interest.
  * `verbatimOutput` will print arbitrary R objects to the shiny UI



```r
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
  output$debug &lt;- verbatimOutput({
    # intermediate data structure 
  })
}
```

---

### Debugging Shiny Apps

A general principle for debugging: If you are very stuck, it helps to simplify
the problem. Pare away parts of the code that seem unrelated to the bug until
you arrive at a minimal example that reproduces the same buggy behavior. In the
process, you may discover the solution, and even if not, you will have a version
of the code that others can easily give feedback on.

---

### In-Class Demo [5 - 1]

* We will give a new solution to part (c) of [California Wildfires] in the
exercise sheet, but this time using graphical queries.
* Starter code is available here: https://go.wisc.edu/

---

### In-Class Discussion [5 - 1]

Document: https://go.wisc.edu/

Prompt: Right now, the dotplot responds to the brushed histogram. However,

  * The dotplot does not allow any user inputs.
  * The histogram does not reflect year or user selections.

Imagine someone came to your statistical consulting hours with this application.
They want your expertise to improve the app so that it conveys more information.
How would you approach this? What might be some first steps towards
implementation?

---

### In-Class Exercise [5 - 1]

We will work through the [Code Analysis] exercise again, but for material from
Shiny. https://go.wisc.edu/

[Code Analysis] Pick one code example from this week’s lecture notes. Provide a
3 - 4 sentence summary of the overall implementation strategy. Then, add
comments every 10 - 15 lines describing what each section of code is doing. If
there are parts that you do not understand, add a ??? next to it (we will review
these in the next lecture).

dataset
[here](https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/hvplyr3jy6vbt7s80lqgfx81ai4hdl0q.csv)
contains the number of streams for this song across regions, for each day in
which it was in the Spotify 100 most streamed songs for that region. Create a
`tsibble` object from this dataset, keying by `region` and indexing by `date`.


```r
song &lt;- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/hvplyr3jy6vbt7s80lqgfx81ai4hdl0q.csv")

### Review

_When would prior and posterior predictions be used?_

* Whenever you are using a Bayesian model and want to compare prior distributions / likelihood models.
* Examples: [Political science](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.polisci.7.012003.104706), [genetics](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1412301112), [psychology](https://www.mskcc.org/sites/default/files/node/176881/documents/2019-06-03-16-06-14/li_schofield_gonen_dptutorial19.pdf), [evolution](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985471/), [epidemiology](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/goel.1/STAT825/PAPERS/CressiePPMC.pdf)
  - Typically problems where there is interest in a compact generative model.
 
_Can UMAP be said to be a dimensionality reduction method for 2D visualization?_

This is an appropriate interpretation, but be aware that you can reduce to more
than just two dimensions with UMAP.

Submission: https://go.wisc.edu/e2r259

[Project Planning] Make a plan for your project's next steps. This should cover
both how you will make your visualizations and how you will prepare your
presentation/report?

* What are the main categories for the tasks that remain?
* For each category that you listed, what are the immediate next steps?
* Who is responsible for which part? How will you coordinate?

### Conclusion

1. I have been impressed by your curiosity in the portfolios and projects.
1. Beyond the specific topics, remember the learning techniques: examples,
tinkering, and visual explanations.
1. There are many data analysis problems out there and too many people who fear
statistics -- use your visualization skills to help!

x &lt;- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = rnorm(100, 0, 5)
)
ggplot(x) +
  geom_point(aes(x, y)) +
